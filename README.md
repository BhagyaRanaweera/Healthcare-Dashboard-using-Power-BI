## 1. Data Overview
The dataset includes healthcare-related information such as:
- Patient demographics
- Hospital admissions and discharge data
- Disease prevalence and treatment statistics
- Financial and operational metrics
- Staff performance and workload

## 2. Requirement Gathering
- Identify key stakeholders (doctors, administrators, policymakers).
- Define essential KPIs such as patient wait times, readmission rates, and treatment efficiency.
- Determine data sources and reporting needs.

## 3. Data Collection
- Collect data from  hospital databases from kagel.
- Ensure data completeness, consistency, and accuracy.
- Store data in an accessible format for Power BI integration.

## 4. Transformation & Modelling
- Clean and preprocess data using **Power Query** in Power BI and Excel.
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Create relationships between datasets for seamless analysis.
- Define measures and calculated columns using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**.

## 5. Visualization Blueprint
- Design wireframes and sketches for the dashboard layout.
- Plan visualizations such as:
  - Patient volume trends (Line charts)
  - Disease distribution (Pie/Donut charts)
  - Hospital performance (Bar charts, KPI indicators)
 
## 6. Layout & Design Workflow
- Use a **clear, concise, and color-coded** layout.
- Prioritize user-friendly design with **interactive slicers and drill-throughs**.
- Maintain accessibility standards for all users.

## 7. Adding Interactivity & Navigation
- Implement **filters and slicers** for dynamic data selection.

## 8. Publishing & Sharing
- **Power BI Service**: Publish reports for cloud access and real-time updates.
